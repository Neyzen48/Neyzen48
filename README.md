# Hello, dear visitor ðŸ‘‹  

Youâ€™ve landed on my GitHub profile.  
On the right ðŸ‘‰ (or at the bottom ðŸ‘‡ on mobile) youâ€™ll find some of my repositories â€”  
feel free to explore, fork, or just get inspired.  

I like building things that scale, break, and get rebuilt better.  
Mostly playing around with **full-stack development**, **cloud-native systems**,  
and whatever sparks curiosity at the moment.
